# cursed-objects
Museum objects. But cursed... Mwahahahaha!

Run: `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`

---

Aim: A single page site that shows an image of a 3D object from a museum and the text of machine generated 'curse'.
MVP elements:
* Curse generator using tracery.js
* Pull the object metadata in for name/type/origin/backlink
* Image grabber (Choose an API from here). First choice: PAS (finds.org.uk)

Built with node.js?

Bonus:

* Fancy languages - Latin, fake Old English, Germanic, Hebraic, Greek - lots of accents and characters.
* Collection search - search for 'horse'. Shows you 5 (?) items only 1 is cursed
* Find objects near me
* Period specific curses (Romano-British, Elizabethan, Anglo-Saxon…)
* Report button - ethically dubious pairing (colonial objects etc)
* Persistent URLs for a given output
* Social share buttons
* Share n times to lift the curse

Inspiration:
* Lewis Pollard's Museum Generator bot
* Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum
